# Electric Vehicle Data Analysis (Tableau)

## Overview
This project focuses on the analysis of electric vehicles (EVs) based on a dataset containing information about various vehicles, including their type (BEV/PHEV), make, model, CAFV eligibility, and geographical distribution. Using **Tableau**, the dataset is visualized interactively, providing valuable insights into the electric vehicle market.

The analysis aims to:
- Track the **growth** of electric vehicle adoption.
- Analyze the **distribution** of electric vehicles across states and models.
- Provide insights on the **market dominance** of various manufacturers and the **impact of CAFV incentives**.

## Data Analysis Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. **Total Vehicles**: 
   - Total count of all electric vehicles, including both BEVs and PHEVs.

2. **Average Electric Range**: 
   - Calculation of the average electric range across all vehicles in the dataset, helping gauge technological advancements and efficiency.

3. **Total BEV Vehicles & % of Total**:
   - Focuses on Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs), including their total number and percentage compared to the overall number of electric vehicles.

4. **Total PHEV Vehicles & % of Total**:
   - Analyzes Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), their total count, and percentage of the total electric vehicle population.
